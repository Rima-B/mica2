# Define study aggregations following these format rules:
#
# <field>:
#
#
# <field>:
#   properties:
#     type: "terms" | "stats"
#
#
# <field>:
#   properties:
#     localized: "true"
#
# <field>:
#   properties:
#     alias: "toto"
#
# NOTE: 'localized' aggregations can only be applied to 'terms' types. In addition, the value 'true' must be quoted a
# shortcoming of the YAML processor.
